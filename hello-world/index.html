<h2><span id="who-are-you">Who are you?</span></h2><p>I am a young, untraditionally taught programmer who works for a startup in Munich. My team and I use typescript and angular daily although my interests also lie in artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, I have been very lucky to have had a great upbringing and also to have discovered self-improvement. Self-improvement has, after the two years that I have been actively pursuing it, helped me to get start a programming career with 0 experience, get well on the way to my physical goals and develop a strong mental state among other things.</p>
<h2><span id="what-are-you-going-to-be-writing-about">What are you going to be writing about?</span></h2><p>I plan to write about four main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Angular</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Rust (I am currently a beginner so bare with me here)</li>
<li>JavaScript/ TypeScript</li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to be including code snippets and live examples whilst trying to keep the posts under a ten-minute read and to the point. A Tl;dr will be included where this is not possible; I know how frustrating it can be to try to get information from some overly long post. </p>
<p>If you feel that I need to expand on something that I am writing about, feel free to let me know! I love to help.</p>
<h2><span id="how-often-will-you-be-posting">How often will you be posting?</span></h2><p>Once a week is the goal. Working full time and commuting doesn’t leave much time left over. As mentioned above, I will be reinforcing what I have learnt by teaching it and I learn quite a bit so hopefully I will be able to post more often. We’ll see.</p>
<h2><span id="who-are-you-writing-for">Who Are You Writing For?</span></h2><p>People who want to learn to program (better) and/or keep up to date with the latest technological developments in the areas mentioned above. I guess if you are reading this, you probably are a software developer or want to become one. Blog posts were a critical part in achieving my goal of becoming a web developer. I feel that these posts could help you in the same way!</p>
<h2><span id="how-can-i-get-involved">How can I get involved?</span></h2><p>Comment below the posts, create pull requests on the examples, share the content if you think your circle would also find it useful.</p>
